## Course Description

Information Retrieval (IR) is an area that aims at answering user information needs with the most relevant information. In this course we shall study how search applications, e.g. Google, compute relevant search results from a repository of Web information.

This course starts by dissecting a search engine, and discusses the fundamental techniques currently used in information retrieval. Afterwards, the most relevant algorithms and retrieval models are discussed in detail.

The current demand for intuitive search processes and language comprehension have been alligning Natural Language Processing (NLP) and IR. In this course you will learn fundamental techniques, that are used to encode syntax, grammar, and semantics in machines. 

This course includes extensive hands-on laboratories where key retrieval and NLP algorithms are examined. The goal is to strengthen students’ experimental analysis and critical thinking skills concerning search performance metrics and experimental results.

## Objectives
- Learn the concept of information relevance.
- Learn how to parse and analyze text data.
- Learn how to rank information by relevance.
- Analysis of experimental results.

## Grading
Exam (40%) + Lab work (60% with three submissions)
