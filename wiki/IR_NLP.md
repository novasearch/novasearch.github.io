## Course Description

Information Retrieval is an area that aims at answering user information needs with the most relevant information. In this course we shall study how search applications compute relevant search results from a repository of Web information.

This course starts by dissecting a search engine and discusses the fundamental techniques currently used in information retrieval. Afterwards, the most relevant algorithms and retrieval models are discussed in detail.

This course includes extensive hands-on laboratories where key retrieval algorithms are examined. The goal is to strengthen studentsâ€™ experimental analysis and critical thinking skills concerning search performance metrics and experimental results.
